# KafkaNeo4JConnector
Connector to execute Neo4J-Commands written in Cypher or JCypher via a Kafka-Topic

#Differences to other Neo4J Connectors
This connector support JCypher and uses the Apache-Kafka-Streams model. Other Connectors only support simple Cypher-Commands and use an architecture that uses a Apache Kafka producer and a consumer to listen and print to topics.
